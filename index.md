<!--## About me-->
I am a postdoctoral researcher at ETH Zurich, where I work with the [Rycolab](https://rycolab.io) in the Institute for Machine Learning, Department of Computer Science; and a member of the [ELLIS Society](https://ellis.eu). Previously, I was a PhD student at the University of Amsterdam in the [Institute for Logic, Language and Computation](https://www.illc.uva.nl). I study language processing in humans and machines using tools from computer science, linguistics, and cognitive science.

My research is currently concerned with:
- Language modelling (learning, inference, interpretability and evaluation)
- Computational semantics and pragmatics
- Computational modelling of language variation and change 

<!--
What I am most excited about is studying human language use via computational models of language understanding and generation. This is the main topic of my PhD, which I address by combining machine learning, information theory, and (psycho-, socio-, cognitive) linguistics.

I analyse and model language production and comprehension with computational methods. My main research goal is to define empirical measures of human-likeness that can be used (i) to evaluate the alignment of machine-generated utterances to human communication patterns and strategies, and (ii) to develop NLG models that more closely follow such patterns and strategies. I am also interested in psycholinguistic and sociolinguistic studies of variation and change as they provide insights into how to build more resilient and human-compatible language technologies.-->


##### It's-a me, Mario  
Born and raised in Italy, I spent three years in Germany as a undergraduate student of Computational Linguistics at the [University of Tübingen](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/) and then moved to Amsterdam for a Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence. 
During my Bachelor's studies, I worked both as a teaching and as a research assistant for the [Department of General and Computational Linguistics](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/faculties/faculty-of-humanities/departments/modern-languages/department-of-linguistics/), and I served a five-month internship in the IBM department for social media analytics.
As a Master's student, I have collected more teaching and research experience, collaborating with an interdisciplinary set of scholars and students at the [Institute for Logic, Language and Computation](https://www.illc.uva.nl). I graduated with a thesis on the detection and analysis of lexical semantic change. As a PhD candidate at the University of Amsterdam, I worked in the ILLC's [Dialogue Modelling Group](https://dmg-illc.github.io/dmg/) under the supervision of [Raquel Fernández](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/r.fernandezrovira/) and together with many amazing colleagues—and I wrote a thesis on [_Neural Models of Language Use_](https://eprints.illc.uva.nl/id/eprint/2274/1/DS-2023-10.text.pdf).
<!--
In July 2017 I graduated with a thesis that proposes [new methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.03910) for the analysis of affective text.
Currently I study Artificial Intelligence at the University of Amsterdam.
