## About me
Born and raised in Italy, I moved to Germany to start a Bachelor in Computational Linguistics at the [University of TÃ¼bingen](https://www.uni-tuebingen.de/en/university/profile/history-of-the-university.html). 
During my Bachelor's studies, I worked both as a teaching and as a research assistant for the Department of General and Computational Linguistics ([SfS](http://www.sfs.uni-tuebingen.de/en/chairs.html)), and I
served a five-month internship in the [Watson Analytics for Social Media](https://www.ibm.com/us-en/marketplace/social-media-data-analysis/details#product-header-top) department of IBM. In July 2017 I graduated with a
thesis proposing [new methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.03910) for the analysis of affective text.
Currently I study Artificial Intelligence at the University of Amsterdam.
