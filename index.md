## Bio
Born and raised in Italy, I moved to Germany to start a Bachelor in Computational Linguistics at the [University of Tübingen](https://www.uni-tuebingen.de/en/university/profile/history-of-the-university.html). 
During my Bachelor's studies, I worked both as a teaching and as a research assistant for the Department of General and Computational Linguistics ([SfS](http://www.sfs.uni-tuebingen.de/en/chairs.html)), and I
served a five-month internship in the [Watson Analytics for Social Media](https://www.ibm.com/us-en/marketplace/social-media-data-analysis/details#product-header-top) department of IBM. In July 2017 I graduated with a
thesis that proposes [new methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.03910) for the analysis of affective text.
Currently I study Artificial Intelligence at the University of Amsterdam.   

## Research interests
I am in love with language interaction and I try to analyse, model, and understand language with computational methods. My main research goal is proposing and evaluating models of semantic reasoning and pragmatic inference that can be applied to tasks such as dialogue modelling, probabilistic language modelling, and representation learning. I am also interested in sociolinguistic studies of variation and change that investigate the dynamics of public discourse with computational techniques.
