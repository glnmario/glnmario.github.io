<!--## About me-->
PhD candidate at the [Institute for Logic, Language and Computation](https://www.illc.uva.nl) of the [University of Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl/en), I work in the [Dialogue Modelling Group](https://dmg-illc.github.io/dmg/) under the supervision of [Raquel Fernández](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/r.fernandezrovira/) and together with many amazing colleagues. My research interest lie in the following areas, which roughly define the boundaries of my projects and publications:
- Computational semantics and pragmatics
- Computational dialogue modelling
- Natural Language Generation 
- Language variation and change in communities of speakers
- Explainability, interpretability, and fair evaluation of NLP models

What I am most excited about is studying human strategies of communication using computational models of language understanding and generation. This is the main topic of my PhD, which I address with machine learning, information theory, and statistical modelling.


<!-- I analyse and model language production and comprehension with computational methods. My main research goal is defining empirical measures of human-likeness that can be used (i) to evaluate the alignment of machine-generated utterances to human communication patterns and strategies, and (ii) to develop NLG models that more closely follow such patterns and strategies. I am also interested in psycholinguistic and sociolinguistic studies of variation and change as they provide insights into how to build more resilient and human-compatible language technologies.-->


##### It's-a me, Mario  
Born and raised in Italy, I spent three years in Germany as a undergraduate student of Computational Linguistics at the [University of Tübingen](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/) and then moved to Amsterdam for a Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence. 
During my Bachelor's studies, I worked both as a teaching and as a research assistant for the [Department of General and Computational Linguistics](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/faculties/faculty-of-humanities/departments/modern-languages/department-of-linguistics/), and I served a five-month internship in the IBM department for social media analytics.
As a Master's student, I have collected more teaching and research experience, collaborating with an interdisciplinary set of [ILLC](https://www.illc.uva.nl) scholars and students. I graduated with a thesis on the detection and analysis of lexical semantic change.
<!--
In July 2017 I graduated with a thesis that proposes [new methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.03910) for the analysis of affective text.
Currently I study Artificial Intelligence at the University of Amsterdam.
