## About me
Born and raised in Italy, I moved to Germany to start a Bachelor in Computational Linguistics at the [University of Tübingen](https://www.uni-tuebingen.de/en/university/profile/history-of-the-university.html). 
During my Bachelor's studies, I worked both as a teaching and as a research assistant for the Department of General and Computational Linguistics ([SfS](http://www.sfs.uni-tuebingen.de/en/chairs.html)), and I
served a five-month internship in the [Watson Analytics for Social Media](https://www.ibm.com/us-en/marketplace/social-media-data-analysis/details#product-header-top) department of IBM. In July 2017 I graduated with a
thesis that proposes [new methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.03910) for the analysis of affective text.
Currently I study Artificial Intelligence at the University of Amsterdam.   

## Research interests
I am in love with human language and with the magic of pragmatic inference. I try to analyse, model, and understand language with computational methods. My main research goal is proposing models of semantic reasoning and pragmatic inference that benefit from the lessons learned from symbolic and sub-symbolic processing.
These models can be evaluated in tasks such as dialogue modelling, semantic and pragmatic parsing, probabilistic language modelling, and representation learning. In future, I would also like to explore the areas of cognitive linguistics and sociolinguistics.

_Presented at [CLIN28](http://clin28.cls.ru.nl/#abstract-49), Computational Linguistics in the Netherlands._
- Evaluating the syntactic competence of RAN language models.
- Extraction of event graphs from Kafka’s short stories.   
  Automatic annotation of emotional events and temporal relations.
- Response time of German native speakers reacting to different types of foreign mispronunciations.   

## GitHub
- [emo2vec](https://github.com/Procope/emo2vec/blob/master/README.md): expand an emotion lexicon via label propagation and learn emotion-specific word embeddings from an annotated corpus.
